1) Fun is not a type of Expr, therefore Expr as a given cannot be described in terms of fun.

2) We can fix this problem by making Fun of type Expr. (see 3)

3) 

datatype NewExpr = Const of int
| Var of Name
| Neg of Expr
| Plus of Expr * Expr
| Mult of Expr * Expr
| App of Expr * Expr
| Def of Name * Expr;
