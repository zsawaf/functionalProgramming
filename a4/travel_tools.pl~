%% when the list is empty, the count is zero. The second is the case where the highway we
%% are looking at is a member of the highwaylist, and in this case all we need to do is 
%% recursively call on the tail of the original path. The last case is the case where the 
%% highway is not a member of the list, and in this case we need to increment N by 1. 
%% The way this works is, recursive calls will be made, we'll go back to N=0 at the base 
%% case, and then with each recursive step, N is incremented by the number of recursive steps
%% it took when HW was not a member of HWList.
